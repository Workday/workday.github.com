Today, at Workday Altitude, we announced our plans to open the 
[Workday Cloud Platform](https://www.workday.com/en-us/applications/workday-cloud-platform.html) 
for customers and the Workday broader ecosystem to build extensions and applications for their unique businesses. 
You can read more about the news here in a [blog post by Aneel](http://blogs.workday.com/open-up-workday-cloud-platform/).

Prior to Workday Altitude, we ran an internal hackathon. Over a 24-hour period, teams of Workday developers competed with each other to build innovative extensions and applications using Workday Developer APIs covering Workday 
Financial Management, Human Capital Management, Core Services, Student, Data Analytics and others.

Big shout outs to the three winning teams and their incredible applications:

* 1st place: Slacker-team: Tim Sullivan, Hari Mahendrakumar, Seamus Donohue, Prach Phalabhiromya and Vamsi Thummala

    Added 'Kevin Bacon' to Slack to connect everyone through a single degree of freedom to the time-saving expert they need to solve any of their work day problems. The 'bacon' command finds the right person to talk to; the 'nice-bacon' command helps us to learn who provides the best bacon and serve it up even better next time.

* 2nd place: These Puns Need a REST: Mike Barrameda, Julian Prokay, Ben McCurdy, Omar Masri and Long Cheng

    Built a mobile application to help     students looking for jobs after they graduate. The app used public data from Workday HR customers and outside sources, like Glassdoor, to “match” students with job listings that fit their profile. They can "swipe-right” for jobs they liked and apply instantaneously.

* 3rd place: PaaSteurized: Jasmine Schladen, Atlee Lyden, Bjorn Hamel and Harrison Yu

    Allows a Workday end user to export their job data from multiple Workday tenants over their career and have this data written to a Workday-owned blockchain. Workday customers can use the blockchain to cryptographically verify a user’s work history across multiple companies.


It’s an exciting time for Workday, and we are all looking forward to seeing what our employees and the broader Workday community is going to do in this next phase of our journey together!
