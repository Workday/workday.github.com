[ShipItCon 2017](http://shipitcon.com/) Dublin is being held in the Mansion House this August. 
Workday Dublin's Frederic Meyer will be giving a talk about *"Continuous Delivery @ Workday"*, giving a peek at the magic behind how we 
continually deliver the latest software to 1000's of Workday Customers.

<br/>
Drop over to Workday's booth at the conference, say "Hello" and get to meet some of the awesome developers from the Build Engineering Team.
They would love to meet you.
