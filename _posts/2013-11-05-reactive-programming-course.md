Martin Oderskys new [Principles of Reactive Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) 
online course from Coursera started this week.  Last year a number of us really enjoyed doing the 
[Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun). 
We use Scala and Akka a fair bit here, so we are really looking forward to this course.


If you are interested there's still time to sign up for the course, the first videos were released this week. You need to know Scala and ideally have completed the previous course.  

If you are in Dublin, Ireland - we are planning a study group at the [Dublin Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Scala-users-group/events/142429672/) - come along and join us - all welcome.
