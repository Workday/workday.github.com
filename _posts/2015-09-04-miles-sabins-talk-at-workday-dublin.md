Thanks to everyone who came to the [Dublin Scala Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Scala-users-group/events/223835810/) at Workday's new Dublin office. 
[Miles Sabin](https://twitter.com/milessabin) gave a fascinating talk on "Codecs for free! - shapeless type class derivation in action"

For those who couldn't make it, the video is now available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaOiBdrM8uo&feature=youtu.be).

Enjoy!
