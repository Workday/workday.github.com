What’s different about a Workday Hackathon? For one, a Jedi battles Darth Vader.

The Workday Hackathon is an annual 24 hour event where workmates get to work on whatever project they would like. The only rule: *Don’t do your day job*. 

With only the mere essentials provided (food, caffeine, and commemorative t-shirts), the hacker codes at speed and does whatever it takes to get the job done. Despite the exhaustion of an all-nighter, the hacker creates remarkable feats of engineering and shares the results on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHRWr7QqQCU&feature=youtu.be). 

Our hackers have now returned to their day jobs, building exciting new features for our Workday customers.
