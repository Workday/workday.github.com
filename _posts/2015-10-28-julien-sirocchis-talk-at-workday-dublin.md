At a recent Scala Meetup in Dublin, Workday's [Julien Sirocchi](https://twitter.com/JSirocchi) gave a talk on "Algebraic Data Types and the power of Scala Type Classes". This talk complements Miles Sabin's talk (also published here) by explaining how Type Classes and ADTs can be combined to achieve ad-hoc polymorphism.

The video is now available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yclU599aVk).
