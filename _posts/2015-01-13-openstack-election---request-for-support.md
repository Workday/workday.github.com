This week the OpenStack community will elect eight members to be part of the 2015 Board of Directors. For more information see [2015 Individual Director Election](http://www.openstack.org/election/2015-individual-director-election/)

Workday is participating this year by proposing [Edgar Magana](https://twitter.com/emaganap) as candidate for the Board as Individual Director.

Edgar has been an OpenStack member since 2011 as a part of the founding team of the networking project Neutron (formerly known as Quantum). He is still a core developer and his contributions have been extended to projects such as nova, devstack, docs and heat.

Edgar has a PhD on Distributed Systems from the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona Spain. Edgar has experience in Cloud Computing, Network Virtualization, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), OpenFlow and most importantly OpenStack.

While working in companies such as Cisco, and PLUMgrid, Edgar has completed successful OpenStack deployments in heterogeneous and scalable infrastructures using vendor-specific and commodity hardware. He has contributed back to the community improvements to both OpenStack code as well as configuration systems such as Puppet and Chef. Edgar has promoted the growth of the OpenStack community across continents, giving presentations in conferences in Asia, Europe and America.

We wish Edgar well in his commitment to make OpenStack a truly scalable, operable and production ready Cloud Management System and we would ask to have your support for him in this year's Election.
