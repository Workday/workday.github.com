Yuriy Polyulya presented at [Scala Days Amsterdam 2015](http://event.scaladays.org/scaladays-amsterdam-2015#!#schedulePopupExtras-6964)

# Abstract

If you're using a structure that's very like a monad, but isn't one, then maybe it's an arrow. Arrows are a general functional programming technique, popular in Haskell, but so far undeservedly overlooked in Scala.

This is a short talk and study case about:

* functions and syntax extension for arrows 
* arrow type-class 
* what are arrows and how to use them 
* arrows and categories 
* arrows and monads.
