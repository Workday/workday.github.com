Look it’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Workday at [Grace Hopper](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/) next week!

We will be at the world's largest gathering of women technologists in **Booth #1305** to:

* chat with folks
* give away schwag
* schedule interviews
* help us raise $$ for [Capes4Heroes](http://capes4heroes.com/) by:
1. picking up your Workday superhero cape at our booth 
2. taking a pic of yourself wearing the cape at GHC
3. tagging the photo **#GHC16** & **#Capes4heroes** on social media

<br/>
For each tagged photo, Workday will donate to Capes4Heroes!

Check our latest [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky9DkwQuUjA&feature=youtu.be) about Workday culture to see how much fun we’re having changing the way people work.

Hope to see you at Grace Hopper.  And we’re up, up, and away!
