Workday are proud to be a [sponsor](http://scaladays.org/#sponsors) of Scala Days in Berlin 2014. 


Scala Days is the 
premier Scala conference and this year it's back in Europe. The [schedule](http://scaladays.org/#schedule) is out already and
it looks pretty great this year. The main problem is choice. We are already facing the tyranny of having to choose between 
Concurrency vs Big Data and Akka programming vs Reactive talks.

Somehow we'll manage ...  we mentioned it was in Berlin right? 

Hope to see you there!
