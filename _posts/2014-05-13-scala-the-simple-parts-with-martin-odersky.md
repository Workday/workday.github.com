**Scala Meetup San Francisco - May 22nd** 

Join Typesafe and Workday for a SF Scala meetup with featured guest, Martin Odersky, creator of the Scala language and Chairman & Co-Founder at Typesafe. Workday's Aneel Bhusri, Co-CEO, and David Clarke, VP of Technology Services, will present how Scala is used at Workday, and then hand things over to Martin for a talk on Scala - The Simple Parts. Martin will present the simple principles underlying the Scala language and discuss the tradeoffs between generality, interoperability, and ease of use in its design.
