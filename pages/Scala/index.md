Here are some resources our developers use when learning Scala. If you have suggestions for us to include, then let us know [@WorkdayDev](https://twitter.com/WorkdayDev)

# First Steps #
* [First Steps to Scala Article](http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/steps.html)
* Setup a Scala development environment (including Eclipse support)  
  [Get the Scala Language Distro](http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/)  
  [Get the Eclipse Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/)  
  Don't like Eclipse? There's also [JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA Scala](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/scala.html)
* Use the REPL - it'll be your best friend and a great way to learn and try out syntax.
* Try [Scala Tour](http://scalatutorials.com/tour/) - interactive tour of the scala language 
* Try [Scala for the Impatient](http://horstmann.com/scala/) - should be enough to get you started


# Useful Links #

* [Scala Lang](http://www.scala-lang.org/) - The Scala Language site / [api docs](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#package) 
* [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com/) - the company behind the Scala hivemind - provides commercial support, courses and the Typesafe Stack (scala + akka + play + spray + slick, etc ). 
* [Twitter Scala School](http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/)
* [Java to Scala cheatsheet](http://techblog.realestate.com.au/java-to-scala-cheatsheet/)
* [StackOverflow Scala Wiki](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/scala/info)
* [Scala Types of Types](http://ktoso.github.io/scala-types-of-types/) - good overview of different types in Scala

# What should be on your bookshelf # 
* [Programming In Scala 2nd Edition by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Bill Venners](http://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_2ed)   
  Definitive, but dare we say it, a little dry. That being said, it's a text-book that's worth reading. 
* [Scala in Depth by Joshua D. Suereth] (http://www.manning.com/suereth/)   
  Excellent book for more advanced topics - don't start with this - but when you are ready, read it, then read it again. 
* [DSLs in Action by Debasish Ghosh](http://www.manning.com/ghosh/)  
  Covers DSLs very well in Ruby, Groovy, Scala and Clojure (Scala gets a lot of coverage).
  Also covers External DSLs with Scala parser combinators generating case class models

# Scala Courses # 

Some excellent free Coursera courses are available. They are 7 weeks long, so it's a commitment, but worth it. Start with the Functional Programming Principles - this teaches functional programming through Scala.  

* [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://class.coursera.org/progfun-2012-001)
* [Principles of Reactive Programming](https://class.coursera.org/reactive-001) 

# Tips #
* [Between Zero & Hero Tips] (https://speakerdeck.com/agemooij/between-zero-and-hero-scala-tips-and-tricks-for-the-intermediate-scala-developer) - Age Mooij's  Scala Tips and Tricks for the intermediate Scala developer
* [StackOverflow Hidden Features of Scala] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1025181/hidden-features-of-scala)

# Style  / Coding Standards # 
* [Scala Style Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/) - mostly naming conventions, indentation style etc.
* [Twitter's coding standards] (http://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/)
* ["Scala In Depth" by Joshua D. Suereth - Chapters 2+3](http://www.manning.com/suereth/) - This contains some good advice similar to "Effective Java"
* [Zen of Python] (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) - provides some good general principles for succinct coding styles, these apply equally well to Scala code

# Practising Scala #  
* We would advise beginners to start with unit-testing their existing Java code in Scala. It's a useful and non-threatening way to start getting to grips with the syntax. Have a look at [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) or [Specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) 
* [Scalatron](http://scalatron.github.com/) a programming game that can help with learning Scala  
* Some puzzles that can be useful as well - [Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

# Functional Programming # 

* [Introduction to Functional Programming] (http://jsuereth.com/intro-to-fp)  
  This is an excellent presentation that shows how functional programming simplifies using APIs and Futures
